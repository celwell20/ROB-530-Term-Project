# SE(3) Particle Filter for Monocular Camera CNN Pose Estimates

This is the readme file for a term project titled "SE(3) Particle Filter for Monocular Camera CNN Pose Estimates". The purpose of this project is to explore the application of a particle filter to improve the accuracy of CNN pose estimates for a monocular camera.

## Introduction
Pose estimation is an important task in computer vision and robotics. It involves determining the position and orientation of an object in a 3D space. One common method for pose estimation is using a monocular camera and a convolutional neural network (CNN) to estimate the pose. However, CNNs can have difficulty accurately estimating poses in certain situations, such as when objects are occluded or the camera is moving rapidly. To address these issues, we propose the use of a particle filter to improve the accuracy of the CNN pose estimates.

## CNN
The CNN used in this project is a standard architecture for pose estimation. It takes an input image and produces a 6-dimensional vector representing the position and orientation of the object in 3D space. We train the CNN on a dataset of synthetic images with known ground truth poses.

## Particle Filter
The particle filter is a Bayesian filtering technique that is commonly used for state estimation in robotics. In this project, we use an SE(3) particle filter to estimate the pose of the object. The particle filter uses a set of particles to represent the distribution of the object's pose. The particles are updated based on the CNN pose estimate and the measurements from the monocular camera.

## Results
We evaluate the performance of the SE(3) particle filter on a dataset of real-world images. We compare the accuracy of the particle filter to the accuracy of the CNN alone. Our results show that the particle filter significantly improves the accuracy of the pose estimates, particularly in situations where the CNN struggles.

## Conclusions
In this project, we have demonstrated the potential of using a particle filter to improve the accuracy of CNN pose estimates for a monocular camera. Our results suggest that the particle filter can be a useful tool for pose estimation in real-world applications. Further research is needed to explore the performance of the particle filter in different settings and with different CNN architectures.
